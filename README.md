# Algorithm_Study
This is an algorithm study group focused on solving coding test problems from the "Coding Test High Score Kit" on the programmers website. We cover topics such as hash, stack/queue, sorting, and complete search, with a focus on improving our problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithms.

We conducted the study for a total of 10 weeks, in the first week we did a simple test, and from the second week to the tenth week, we solved problems related to four tasks. Please refer to the content below for the files corresponding to each task.

# Reflections on the Study
The goal of this study was not to improve coding test scores for employment, but to enhance coding skills. If the goal was to improve scores, we would have solved many problems in a short period of time, but in this study, our goal was to become familiar with coding by solving 2-3 problems per week. The study lasted for about 3 months and I believe we were successful in becoming familiar with how to logically develop and transform problems into code when faced with a challenge.
